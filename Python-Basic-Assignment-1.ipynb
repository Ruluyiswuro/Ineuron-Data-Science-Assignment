In any programming language, an expression is evaluated as per the precedence of its operators. So that if there is more than one operator in an expression, their precedence decides which operation will be performed first. The interpreter evaluates the expression and displays the result."

So that if there is more than one operator in an expression, their precedence decides which operation will be performed first.\n",
    "    A statement is a unit of code that has an effect, like creating a variable or displaying a value.When we type a statement, the interpreter executes it, which means that it does whatever the statement says. In general, statements donâ€™t have values. A statement is an instruction that a Python interpreter can execute. There are mainly four types of statements in Python, Print statements, Assignment statements, Conditional statements and Looping statements."

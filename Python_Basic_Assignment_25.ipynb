    "An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. It provides a way to access elements sequentially, one at a time, without the need to store the entire sequence in memory. Iterators are implemented using the iterator protocol, which requires the presence of two methods: __iter__() and __next__().\n",

    "Generators are a convenient way to create iterators. They are defined using a special kind of function called a generator function or using generator expressions. Generators are implemented using a function. Just as iterators, generators also follow lazy evaluation. Here, the yield function returns the data without affecting or exiting the function. It will return a sequence of data in an iterable format where we need to iterate over the sequence to use the data as they wonâ€™t store the entire sequence in the memory."
